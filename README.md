# Augmented Void Reavers

Makes Void Reavers more threatening by adding a "new" primary and applying nullify quicker. Each stack of nullify applied applies another stack so if you're hit by 2 bubbles you're rooted. Changed some AI values so visions fire at medium range, portalbomb fires at close and long range.

Kit:
  - Primary Visions of the Void (its just visions of heresy with 3 stacks instead of 12)
  - Secondary Void Portal Bomb (original attack but reworked to be better - able to be mid air and predictive)
