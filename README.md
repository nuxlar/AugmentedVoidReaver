# Augmented Void Reavers

Makes Void Reavers more threatening by adding a "new" primary, enhanced secondary, and tweaked AI. Visions fire at medium range, portalbomb fires at close and long range.

Kit:
  - Primary Visions of the Void (its just visions of heresy with 3 stacks instead of 12)
  - Secondary Void Portal Bomb (original attack but reworked to be better - able to be mid air and predictive)
